To create a README.md file with formatted headings and text, you can use Markdown syntax. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax that allows you to add headings, lists, links, and more. Hereâ€™s how you can structure your README.md file with appropriate headings and formatting:

```markdown
# Object Recognition using Deep Learning

## Overview
Implemented an object recognition system using YOLO v5 for detecting objects in images and videos. The system was deployed as a web application using FastAPI.

## Technologies Used
- FastAPI
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- YOLO v5

## Project Structure
Describe the structure of your project here, detailing the main files and directories.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

## Screenshots
Include screenshots or GIFs of your application in action (if applicable).

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this project. Contributions are always welcome!

### Explanation:

- **Markdown Syntax**: Use `#` for main headings (`##` for subheadings), `-` for bullet points, and backticks for code blocks.
  
- **Overview**: Briefly describe your project in the "Overview" section.
  
- **Technologies Used**: List the main technologies or frameworks used in your project.
  
- **Project Structure**: Optionally, provide an overview of your project's directory structure.
  
- **Installation**: Include steps to clone the repository and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  
- **Usage**: Describe how to run and use your application locally.
  
- **Screenshots**: If applicable, include visuals of your application to showcase its functionality.
  
- **Contributing**: Encourage others to contribute to your project.
  
- **License**: Specify the license under which your project is distributed.

### Tips:

- **Formatting**: Ensure you use proper Markdown syntax for headings (`#`, `##`), lists (`-`), code blocks (`````), and links (`[text](url)`).
  
- **Preview**: Use a Markdown editor or previewer (like VS Code with Markdown All in One extension) to see how your README will look on GitHub before committing changes.

By following this structure, you can create a well-formatted README.md file that effectively communicates the purpose, setup instructions, and usage of your object recognition project using deep learning. Adjust the content as per your project specifics and preferences.
