# Object Recognition using Deep Learning

## Overview
I implemented a React application for an object detection system using YOLO v8 for detecting objects in images. The system was deployed as a web application using FastAPI.

## Technologies Used
- FastAPI
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- YOLO v5



## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
  

2. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. Start the FastAPI server:
   
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

- **Formatting**: Ensure you use proper Markdown syntax for headings (`#`, `##`), lists (`-`), code blocks (`````), and links (`[text](url)`).
  
- **Preview**: Use a Markdown editor or previewer (like VS Code with Markdown All in One extension) to see how your README will look on GitHub before committing changes.

By following this structure, you can create a well-formatted README.md file that effectively communicates the purpose, setup instructions, and usage of your object recognition project using deep learning. Adjust the content as per your project specifics and preferences.
